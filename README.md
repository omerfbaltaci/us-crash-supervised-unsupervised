# US Crash Analysis: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning

## Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of a dataset containing information about US crashes. The analysis includes both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to understand patterns and make predictions based on the data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains detailed information about various crashes in the US. The key features of the dataset include:

- **Date and Time**: When the crash occurred
- **Location**: Geographic information of the crash
- **Severity**: The severity of the crash
- **Weather Conditions**: Weather conditions at the time of the crash
- **Road Conditions**: Conditions of the road where the crash occurred

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
The project is organized as a Jupyter notebook. To explore the analysis, open the notebook using Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook us-crash-supervised-unsupervised.ipynb
```

The notebook is structured as follows:

1. **Introduction**: Overview of the project and dataset
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and understanding the data
4. **Supervised Learning**: Building and evaluating predictive models
5. **Unsupervised Learning**: Applying clustering techniques to discover patterns
6. **Conclusion**: Summarizing findings and potential next steps

## Results
The results section of the notebook presents the key findings from both the supervised and unsupervised learning analyses. This includes the performance metrics of the predictive models and the insights gained from clustering the data.

## Future Work
Potential future work could include:
- Enhancing the feature engineering process to improve model performance
- Exploring additional machine learning algorithms
- Conducting a more detailed analysis of specific crash types or conditions
